	big thanks goes to KetilO, he saved me lot of gray hairs :)
	
 --------------------------------------------------------------

	QuickEval Adding enables you to use Output window (F6 toggles this window)
	to evaluate some simple (or complex) math expressions.
	
	To invoke addin you type expression in Output window and hit Enter key, but line
	on which you typed your expression must begin with question mark (?)
	
	example:
	
		? (2 + 2) / 2
		
	will print:
		
		2
	
	
	QuickEval supports following operators (sorted by precedence):
	
	( top of the list has highest precedence )
	
	
	( )	- parentheeses (used to override order operator precedence)
	
	^		- exponentiation
	
	-		- negation (unary minus)
	
	*		- multiplication
	/		- division
	
	\		- integer division
	
	Mod	- modulus (remainder of integer division)
	
	+		- addition
	-		- subtraction
	
	Shl	- shift bits left
	Shr	- shift bits right
	
	=		- equal
	<>		- not equal
	<		- less than
	>		- greater than
	<=		- less than or equal
	>=		- greater than or equal
	
	Not	- bitwise Not (unary)
	
	And	- bitwise And
	
	Or		- bitwise Or
	
	Xor	- bitwise Xor
	Imp	- bitwise Imp
	Eqv	- bitwise Eqv
	
	
	all this operators behave just like FB's corresponding operators
	
	
	QuickEval also has support for calling functions.
	
	List of supported functions:
	
	LoByte
	HiByte
	LoWord
	Bit
	BitReset
	BitSet
	Abs
	Exp
	Log
	Sqr
	Fix
	Frac
	Int
	Sgn
	Sin
	ASin
	Cos
	ACos
	Tan
	Atn
	ATan2
	
	These functions behave just like FB's corresponding function.
	
	
	NOTE: 
		QuickEval is (like FreeBASIC) case-insensitive meaning that LOBYTE is same as lobyte 
		(this is true for functions and also for operators)
		
		
	QuickEval recognizes number in decimal (either integer or floating-point), hexadecimal,
	octal and binary formats. 
	
	They are written just like in FB, for example hexadecimal 1FF is written as &H1FF
	
	This feature (numbers in hexadecimal, octal and binary format) lets you use QuickEval
	as simple base converter, for example:
	
	if you type:
	
		? &B101010
	
	you'll get:
	
		42
	
 --------------------------------------------------------------	 
 	
 	Version 1.1 changes:
 	
 	- added support for strings ("double quote delimited strings")
 	
 	- added string concatenation operator & (same precedence as + and -)
 	
 	- added string handling functions:
 	
 	Asc
 	Chr		(limited to maximum of 8 parameters)
 	Bin
 	Oct
 	Hex
 	Format
 	Val
 	ValInt
 	ValUInt
 	Mkd
 	Mki
 	Mkl
 	Mks
 	MkShort
 	Cvd
 	Cvi
 	Cvs
 	CvShort
 	Left
 	Mid		(function, not stamenet)
 	Right
 	LCase
 	UCase
 	LTrim		(only one parameter version supported)
 	RTrim		(only one parameter version supported)
 	Trim		(only one parameter version supported)
 	InStr		(Any keyword not supported)
