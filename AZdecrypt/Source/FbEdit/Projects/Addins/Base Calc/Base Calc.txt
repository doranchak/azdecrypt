Not long ago, Merick asked, on the FB.net forums, for a feature addition in FB IDE.  He wanted to have something to convert between number bases.  I said it sounded like an AddIn.  So I made it.

Base Calc
It adds an Item in the Tools menu.  When it's window comes up, just type the number in the appropriate box, and it will convert it to to the other bases.

It supports Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal.

If anyone finds any problems, let me know.
