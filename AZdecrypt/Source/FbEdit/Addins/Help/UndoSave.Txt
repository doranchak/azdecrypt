This addin saves and loads undo information on project code files.

How does it work:
-----------------

Saving:
When a project code file is saved its undo information is stored in ram.
The dos filetime is also saved in case a file is modified outside FbEdit.
You can close the file at any time without loosing the undo information.
When the project is closed the undo information for all files is stored in
the file [PROJECTNAME].undo. This file can grow large over time. You can
use Edit / Empty Undo Buffer on individual files or you can just delete
the [PROJECTNAME].undo file if you dont need it anymore.

Loading:
When a project is opened and a [PROJECTNAME].undo file is found the file
is read into ram. When a project code file is opened and its dos filetime
matches then the undo information is restored from ram.
