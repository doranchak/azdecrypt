'This file attempts to make up for the lack of a "far" keyword in GCC. 
'Although it doesn't provide access to far call APIs (like Windows), it
'does allow you to do far pointer data access without the overhead of
'movedata() or dosmemget/dosmemput().
'
'You should *always* include this file when using these functions and
'compile with optimization enabled.  They don't exist as normal functions
'in any library, and they compile down to only a few opcodes when used
'this way.  They are almost as fast as native pointer operations, and
'about as fast as far pointers can get. 
'
'If you don't use optimization, this file becomes prototypes for
'farptr.c, which generates real functions for these when not optimizing. 
'When optimizing, farptr.c compiles to nothing. 
'
'There are two types of functions here - standalone and invariant.  The
'standalone functions take a selector and offset.  These are used when
'you need only a few accesses, time isn't critical, or you don't know
'what's in the %fs register.  The invariant ones don't take a selector,
'they only take an offset.  These are used inside loops and in
'time-critical accesses where the selector doesn't change.  To specify
'the selector, use the farsetsel() function.  That selector is used for
'all farns*() functions until changed.  You can use _fargetsel() if you
'want to temporary change the selector with _farsetsel() and restore
'it afterwards.
'
'The farpoke* and farpeek* take selectors.
'
'The farnspoke* and farnspeek* don't (note the `ns' for `no selector').
'
'Warning: These routines all use the %fs register for their accesses. 
'GCC normally uses only %ds and %es, and libc functions (movedata,
'dosmemget, dosmemput) use %gs.  Still, you should be careful about
'assumptions concerning whether or not the value you put in %fs will be
'preserved across calls to other functions.  If you guess wrong, your
'program will crash.  Better safe than sorry.
