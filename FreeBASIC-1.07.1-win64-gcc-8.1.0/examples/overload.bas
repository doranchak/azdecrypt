'' Operator Overloading for User Defined Types:
''
'' - All binary operators can be overloaded, except the relational ones
''
'' - Self-operators (op=) can be handled separately for better performance
''
'' - Most unary operators can be overloaded, including casting, address-of (@),
''   pointer dereference (*) and UDT member pointer dereference (->)
''
'' - The assignment operator can also be overloaded (operator Let)
