'' The code body of the recursive function is defined by using the recursive definition of the factorial function:
''    Case (n = 0) : factorial(0) = 1
''    Case (n > 0) : factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
''    The first line allows to determine the end condition: 'If (n = 0) Then Return 1'
''    The second line allows to determine the statement syntax which calls the function itself: 'Return n * factorial(n - 1)'
