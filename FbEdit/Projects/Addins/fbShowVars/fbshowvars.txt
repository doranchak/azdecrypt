'' original code: Public Domain, by Brad Byrne 2004
'' routines for dialogs by MichaelW (thx)
'' adapted and modified for freebasic, by Denise_Amiga
''
'' here is a handy little include file which will allow you to easily view
'' a string, double precision Float, or a Integer value during runtime,
'' can be very helpful while debugging or designing.
''
'' syntax:
''  ShowVar ( "label", integer var )
''  ShowVar ( "label", string var )
''  ShowVar ( "label", float var )
''
'' (see following example.bas file for use)
'' also should mention that the "label" label portion can be anything, and the
'' routine checks for and updates on simalar labels so if you wish to check
'' the same variable before and after something you can just: as example;
'' ShowVar ( "before xxx", varA )
'' do something
'' ShowVar ( "after xxx", varA )
''
'' happy debugging!!!
