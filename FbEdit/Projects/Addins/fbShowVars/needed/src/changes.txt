- Fixed some stack corruptions.
- Fixed few typos in the disasm.h database. 
- Fixed sib_mul_reg special case, when it should be equal to NULL
- When sign extension is found, DISIT keeps the orginal IMM size
  (last version was not doing that)


I would like to thank "pelle aka i42" for mailing me with some of this
issues, due to that fact i decided to fork a C version today :)
